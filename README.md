# IoT-Datasets
A selection of open IoT & Time-Series datasets


### Time-Series
[- Pseudo Periodic Synthetic Time Series](https://data.world/uci/pseudo-periodic-synthetic-time-series): This data set is designed for testing indexing schemes in time series databases. The data appears highly periodic, but never exactly repeats itself.\

[- Causal Effects in Time Series](https://data.world/data-society/causal-effects-in-time-series): To identify which promotions affect sales. Artificial data about 1000 promotions and 100 product sales is provided.\
[- Car Sales Mock Data](https://data.world/vizwiz/car-sales-mock-data): Data created from Mockaroo of a fictitious car company's sales\
[- COVID-19 Singapore](https://data.world/hxchua/covid-19-singapore): Time series data on covid-19 cases in Singapore on counts of confirmed, discharged, hospitalised, deaths, imported cases\
[- U.S.  Air Pollution Data](https://www.kaggle.com/sogun3/uspollution): Air Pollution in the U.S. since 2000-2016.\
[- Global Climate Change Data](https://data.world/data-society/global-climate-change-data): Global Climate Change Data from 1750－2015\
[- Shampoo Sales Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/shampoo.csv):This dataset describes the monthly number of sales of shampoo over a 3 year period.\
[- Minimum Daily Temperatures Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/daily-min-temperatures.csv): This dataset describes the minimum daily temperatures over 10 years (1981-1990) in the city Melbourne, Australia.\
[- Monthly Sunspot Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/monthly-sunspots.csv): This dataset describes a monthly count of the number of observed sunspots for just over 230 years\
[- Daily Female Births Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/daily-total-female-births.csv): This dataset describes the number of daily female births in California in 1959.\
[- EEG Eye State Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/EEG+Eye+State): This dataset describes EEG data for an individual and whether their eyes were open or closed\


### IoT
[- AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance Dataset Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/AI4I+2020+Predictive+Maintenance+Dataset): Since real predictive maintenance datasets are generally difficult to obtain and in particular difficult to publish, we present and provide a synthetic dataset that reflects real predictive maintenance encountered in industry to the best of our knowledge.\
[- Occupancy Detection Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Occupancy+Detection+): This dataset describes measurements of a room and the objective is to predict whether or not the room is occupied.\
[- Ozone Level Detection Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Ozone+Level+Detection): This dataset describes 6 years of ground ozone concentration observations and the objective is to predict whether it is an “ozone day” or not.\
[- The copelabs/usense Dataset](https://crawdad.org/copelabs/usense/20170127/): Data concerning social interaction based on wireless and bluetooth\
[- City of Chicago Water Runoff](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Environment-Sustainable-Development/Smart-Green-Infrastructure-Monitoring-Sensors-Hist/ggws-77ih): Results from a 2017-2018 project of City-installed sensors measuring water runoff from streets and sidewalks.\
[- Household Power Consumption](https://data.world/databeats/household-power-consumption): Individual household electric power consumption dataset collected via submeters placed in 3 distinct areas of a home\
[- Beach Weather Stations - Automated Sensors](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Parks-Recreation/Beach-Weather-Stations-Automated-Sensors/k7hf-8y75): The Chicago Park District maintains weather sensors at beaches along Chicago's Lake Michigan lakefront. These sensors generally capture the indicated measurements hourly while the sensors are in operation during the summer.\
[- MARTA hackathon](https://data.world/brentbrewington/marta-hackathon): Data for the MARTA Smart City + IoT Hackathon\
[- The ExtraSensory Dataset](http://extrasensory.ucsd.edu/): A dataset for behavioral context recognition in-the-wild from mobile sensors\
[- Intel Berkeley Research Lab Sensors](https://www.kaggle.com/caesarlupum/iot-sensordata): Data collected from 54 sensors deployed in the Intel Berkeley Research lab\
[- Gas Sensor Array Drift Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Gas+Sensor+Array+Drift+Dataset): This archive contains 13910 measurements from 16 chemical sensors utilized in simulations for drift compensation in a discrimination task of 6 gases at various levels of concentrations.
